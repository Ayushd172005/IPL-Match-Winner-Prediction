# 🏏 IPL Match Winner Prediction – Machine Learning Project

A **machine learning–based IPL match winner prediction system** that predicts the winning team using **match-related features** such as teams, toss result, toss decision, and venue.  
This project demonstrates practical application of **classification algorithms**, **feature encoding**, and **model evaluation** using Python.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Predicting the outcome of IPL matches is a classic **sports analytics** problem involving multiple categorical variables and uncertainty.  
This project uses **supervised machine learning (classification)** to predict the **match winner** based on historical match attributes.

The project is designed to showcase **end-to-end ML workflow** suitable for **data science, machine learning, and analytics roles**.
